\points{5a} Since fully-supervised VAE (FSVAE) always conditions on an observed $y$ in order to generate the sample $\bx$, 
it is a conditional variational autoencoder. Derive the Evidence Lower Bound $\text{ELBO}(\bx;\theta,\phi,y)$ 
of the conditional log probability $\log p_\theta(\bx \mid y)$. You are allowed to introduce the amortized inference 
model $q_{\phi}(\bz \mid \bx, y)$.
