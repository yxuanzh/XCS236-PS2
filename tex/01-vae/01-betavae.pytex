\points{1d} A popular variation of the normal VAE is called the $\beta$-VAE. The $\beta$-VAE optimizes the following objective:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:6}
    \E_{q_{\phi}(\bz \mid \bx)} [\log p_{\theta}(\bx \mid \bz)] - \beta \KL\left(q_{\phi}\left(\bz \mid \bx\right) \mid\mid p\left(\bz\right)\right)
\end{equation}

Here, $\beta$ is a positive real number. Offer an intuitive interpretation of the impact of $\beta$ on the optimization of the VAE; 
specifically, what happens when $\beta = 1$? How about when $\beta$ is increased above 1? For this question, a qualitative description will suffice.
